<h4><b>Learning objectives</b></h4> 
In this section, you will learn the basics of the statistical programming language R:

* The basic arithmetic operations that you might remember from your math classes: `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`, square root `sqrt()`, logarithms `log()` and `log10()` and the power function `x^y`.
* Working with variables, in particular assigning values to variables with the help of the `<-` operator. 
* Data vectors (R's simplest and most important data structure): creating vectors, creating sequences, and accessing elements of a vector by index.
* Finally, we will learn about the workspace (the environment, where all R objects we create are stored) and the working directory (the location on your computer with which R interacts by importing or exporting data).

<h4><b>Prerequisites</b></h4>
For this part of the tutorial, there are no prerequisites.


## R as a calculator 

R can be used as a (somewhat over-powered) calculator. That means that everything you are used to do with your pocket calculator can also be done in R. In this section, we are going to look at the most important mathematic operations and show how they can be performed in R.

### Basic arithmetic operations

The four most basic operations are *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, and *division*. Let's first have a look at the *addition* and *subtraction* operations. The following code example shows how we can add the numbers $2$ and $3$ and then subtract $0.24$. Note that the second box is the R output we get when we run this code.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
2 + 3 - 0.24
```
</div>

The *multiplication* operation is also straightforward. In the following code example, we show how to multiply $8$ by $8.24$ and the output box gives us the result of this computation ($65.92$).

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
8 * 8.24
```
</div>

Finally, the next code example shows how we can divide two numbers.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
492.2 / 1.3
```
</div>

IMPORTANT: R follows the mathematical convention that multiplication and division precede addition and subtraction. For example, the following code first multiplies $3$ by $4$ and only after adds $2$.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
2 + 3 * 4
```
</div>

If we want to prioritize the addition over the multiplication, we can use parentheses as follows:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
(2 + 3) * 4
```
</div>


### Square root and power function

Other important mathematical functions that we use in R are the square root $\sqrt{x}$ of a number $x$ and taking the power of a number $x$, i.e., $x^y$. The next code example shows that for computing the square root of a number R has a built-in function `sqrt()` that takes one argument, namely the number for which we want to compute the square root. This is the first time we come accross an R function. R provides many built-in functions, i.e., functions that someone else programmed and that are ready to be used. Whenever you will see something like `functionName()`, i.e., a function name followed by (round) parentheses, you will know that it is a R function. You can use a function by typing its function name and providing arguments within the parentheses. So, let's see the `sqrt()` function in action.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
sqrt(2)
```
</div>

So, this simply computes the square root of 2. The next code example shows how to compute the power of a number. For example, we want to compute $3^9$, which can be easily done in R with the following code:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
3^9
```
</div>

### Logarithms 

Last but not least, in Statistics we often need to compute the logarithm of a number (log-transformations of variables are quite common, you will learn about that later on). As you might remember from your math class, you can use different bases when computing the logarithm. A typical base to use is $10$. The following code example shows how to compute the logarithm of $45'000$ with respect to the base $10$.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
log10(45000)
```
</div>

Remember that the result of the above computation is the exponent to which the base $10$ must be raised to get $45'000$, i.e., $10^{4.653213}=45'000$.

Another common base is $e$, which is a mathematical constant ($e=2.718282$). If we use $e$ as our base, we call this the natural logarithm. In R, we can simply use the function `log()` to compute the natural logarithm of some number:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
log(12)
```
</div>

As before, the result R outputs here is the exponent to which $e$ must be raised to get $12$, i.e., $e^{2.484907}=12$.

### Your turn

Now it is time to test your knowledge about basic mathematic operations in R.

```{r, "basic1", exercise = TRUE}
# Add 120 and 56 and subtract 14
```

```{r "basic1-solution"}
120 + 56 - 14
```

```{r, "basic2", exercise = TRUE}
# Take the square root of 4 to the power of 2 (4^2)
```

```{r "basic2-solution"}
sqrt(4^2)
```

```{r, "basic3", exercise = TRUE}
# Compute the logarithm of 100 with respect to base 10
```

```{r "basic3-solution"}
log10(100)
```

  answer("0"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Working with variables

One important concept in R (and in any other programming language) is that we can create variables and assign values or whole data structures to them. Those variables are then stored in the workspace and can be referred to within the R session. We will have a closer look at the workspace in one of the next sections. In this section, we will use simple examples to show how we can create variables and assign values to them, how to overwrite the value of a variable and how to remove a variable from the workspace.

### Creating a variable

Consider the three variables $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 4$. We would like to add these three variables to our workspace in R. For that we need the assignment operator `<-`. For example, we can use the code `a <- 2` to create a variable with the name `a` that stores the (scalar) value $2$. Now we know how to create variables, let's do it in R!

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
a <- 2
b <- 3
c <- 4
```
</div>

We can see that the code above will not create any output in R. We simply created the three variables and they are now stored in our workspace. But we did not yet tell R to output anything. Using the function `ls()` (note that we do not need to provide any function arguments), will print out a vector of variable names that are currently stored in the workspace. Let's try that:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = "", eval = FALSE}
ls()
```
</div>

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat('[1] "a" "b" "c"\n')
```
</div>

We see that the three variables are stored in the workspace and can now be used in R computations.

### Computing with variables

Instead of directly using numbers in computations, we can use the variable names in order to refer to the values assigned to those variable names. For example:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
a * b + c - 5
```
</div>

R will internally replace the variables in the code above with the values assigned to those variables and then perform the computation. This can save you a lot of work if you want to recompute the same expression with different values. It is much easier to change the values of the variables and then to simply rerun the line of code above (the benefit of using variables will be really big if we have large computations with many lines of code and many different variables).

### Changing the value assigned to a variable

If we want to see the value of a variable, we can simply type the name of the variable and run this code (or, type the name of the variable in the console and hit Enter). So, let's see what the current value of the variable `a` is:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
a
```
</div>

Now, let's change the value of `a` (a.k.a. overwrite variable `a`). By printing its new value, we can check if it worked.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
a <- 10
a
```
</div>

Looks good! We changed the value of the variable `a` from `2` to `10`.

### Removing a variable from workspace

In some cases, we might want to remove a variable from the workspace. This can be done with the function `rm()` (`rm` is simply an abbreviation for **r**e**m**ove). In the code example below, we remove `a` from the workspace and check what variables remain in the workspace.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = "", eval = FALSE}
rm(a)
ls()
```
</div>

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = "", echo = FALSE}
cat('[1] "b" "c"\n')
```
</div>

### Your turn

```{r, "var1", exercise = TRUE}
# Create a variable a and assign it the value 33. Multiply a by 5
```

```{r "var1-solution"}
a <- 33
a * 5
```

```{r, "var2", exercise = TRUE}
# Assign the result of 2^4 to the variable b. Then take the square root of b
```

```{r "var2-solution"}
b <- 2^4
sqrt(b)
```

### Quiz

```{r, "var_mc1", echo = FALSE}
question("We create a variable, `a <- 10`, and then run the following code: `b <- a * 3 + 3`. What is the value of `b`?",
  answer("10"),
  answer("33", correct = TRUE, message = "R first multiplies `a` by `3` and then adds `3`. The result of that is assigned to `b`."),
  answer("60"),
  answer("30"),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

```{r, "var_mc2", echo = FALSE}
question("The workspace contains three variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. We run `rm(list=ls())`. Which variables are in the workspace now?",
  answer("`a`, `b`, and `c`"),
  answer("only `a` and `b`"),
  answer("only `c`"),
  answer("None", correct = TRUE, message = "The `rm()` function has a parameter `list` that allows us to specify a list of variable names that R should remove. We know that `ls()` returns a list of all variables in the workspace. Hence, all variables in the workspace will be removed and the workspace will be empty."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Data vectors

A vector is the most important data structure in R. You can think of a data structure as a way of organizing data. A vector is, at its core, a sequence of one or more elements. The key property of a vector is that all its elements must be of the same type. For example, a vector in R cannot contain both numbers and letters at the same time. There are four different types of data that a vector can contain:

* Doubles: simply speaking, doubles are decimal numbers, e.g., `0.254`.
* Integers: an integer is a whole number and can be positive, 0, or negative; e.g., `31`, `0`, `-15`.
* Strings: strings in R are surrounded by double or single quotation marks, e.g., `"car"`, `'bike'`.
* Logicals: `TRUE` or `FALSE` (or abbreviated, `T` or `F`); we will learn about those later on.

In this section, we will mostly focus on doubles because this is the data type that we use most often. Let's first learn how to create a vector in R.

### Creating a vector

In the previous section, when we were creating variables, we were actually creating vectors with one element. Let's create variable `a` again and check its data type with the R function `typeof()`.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
a <- 2
typeof(a)
```
</div>

Hence, `a` is a vector of length 1 and of type `double`. Maybe you wonder why `a` is not of type `integer`, after all you assigned it a whole number. R will interpret all numbers as doubles unless you add a `L` after the number. Let's test that:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
a <- 2L
typeof(a)
```
</div>

But now, let's move on to the important question of how to create longer vectors. For that, we need to use the `c()` function (the `c` stands for concatenate). This function will combine all its arguments to a vector. The following code creates a vector `x` of 5 numbers (doubles). Remember from the previous section that `x` will now be in the workspace and can be used in computations.

<div class = "input">
```{r}
x <- c(10, 14, 4, 1, 3)
```
</div>

We often need to find out how long a vector is (i.e., how many elements it contains), especially for large vectors for which it is not easy to simply count them ourselfs. R provides the `lenght()` function to do that:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
length(x)
```
</div>

Now, you might wonder why vectors are so important. The reason is that most of the functions that you can use in R are built so that they can easily work with vectors. For example, if you want to compute the mean of all numbers in the vector `x`, you can simply write:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
mean(x)
```
</div>

You might also remember the `sqrt()` function. Above, it simply computed the square root of one value. Let's see what happens if we provide the vector `x` as the function argument:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
sqrt(x)
```
</div>

Interesting! R now computes the square root for each value in the vector `x`.

### Creating a sequence

In some cases, you need to create a sequence, for example, `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`. Instead of typing it manually, you can use the colon operator `:`, which saves you a lot of time and work:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
1:10
```
</div>

Note that here we can see the output of the coding block because we do not assign it to a variable. In that case, R just prints the sequence and it will not be stored in the workspace. If you want more options (for example, a step size of 2 instead of 1), you can use the `seq()` function. Look it up yourself! If you want to replicate a vector a number of times, you can use the `rep()` function:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
rep(c(2, 6, 4), times=3)
```
</div>

### Accessing certain values of a vector

Last but not least, let's have a look at how we can access or extract certain elements of a vector. For this, we need to know that every element in a vector has an index. You can think of the index as the position of the element in the vector. In R, the first element of the vector has always index 1. We can use the index within square brackets `[]` to access certain elements. If we want to extract the first element of the vector `x`, we can code the following:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
x[1]
```
</div>

To extract adjacent elements, you can use:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
x[1:2]
```
</div>

To extract non-adjacent elements, you can use:

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
x[c(1,5)]
```
</div>

You can also exclude values with the minus sign. The following code will return all elements of `x` except for the first one.

<div class = "input">
```{r, comment = ""}
x[-1]
```
</div>

### Your turn

Now it is time to test your knowledge about vectors.

```{r, "vec1", exercise = TRUE}
# Create a vector of all whole numbers between 1 and 100 and assign it to y
y <- 
```

```{r "vec1-solution"}
y <- 1:100
```

```{r, "vec2", exercise = TRUE}
# Create a sequence of all even numbers between 0 and 100
```

```{r "vec2-solution"}
seq(from=0, to=100, by=2)
```

```{r, "vec3", exercise = TRUE}
# Extract all elements of vector z except the first and the last
z <- c(2, 4, 3, 11, 34)
```

```{r "vec3-solution"}
z <- c(2, 4, 3, 11, 34)
z[-c(1, 5)]
```

### Quiz

```{r, "vec_mc1", echo = FALSE}
question("We create a vector a as follows: `a <- 10`. Which of the following answers is correct?",
  answer("a has length 1 and is of type string"),
  answer("a is not a vector"),
  answer("a has length 1 and is of type double", correct = TRUE),
  answer("a has length 10 and is of type double"),

  answer("R will create a vector of 3 numbers: `'1' '3' '5'` because 'hello' has 5 letters."),

  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

```{r, "vec_mc3", echo = FALSE}

  answer("5"),
  answer("2"),
  answer("R will output an error message because it is an invalid command."),
  answer("3", correct = TRUE, message = "R measures the length of the vector `x` without the elements 2 and 3. Since `x` initially contains 5 elements, R will return 3."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

  answer("`sqrt(x)`"),
  answer("`sqrt_x <- sqrt(x)`", correct = TRUE, message = "We simply assign the result of the function `sqrt(x)` to the variable `sqrt_x`."),
  answer("`x <- log(x)`"),
  answer("This is not possible in R."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Workspace and working directory

In this section, we will cover two important aspects when working in R: the workspace and the working directory.

### Workspace

We have already briefly coverd the workspace on one of the previous sections. The workspace is the R working environment where all the variables (e.g., vectors) you have created are stored. If you close R, the elements in the workspace will be gone and you will have to create them again the next time you start an R session. It is possible to save an image of the workspace when you close your current R session such that you could reload the same workspace. However, we do not recommend to do that. Instead, just have all your code (variable creations, computations of mean, etc.) in a R script, run this script and the workspace will be filled in a heartbeat.

As mentioned before, we can use the `ls()` function to list all elements that are currently in the workspace (we will not repeat the example here).

### Working directory

Every R session will have a working directory. If you start R, the working directory will be some default location on your computer. The working directory is where R loads files from and where it outputs files to. For example, if we want to import data from some file, R will look for this file in the working directory. Or if we want to save a plot that we generated, R will save the plot to the working directory. But how do we find out what the current working directory is? R provides a simple function for that:

<div class = "input">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd()
```
</div>

<div class = "input">
```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat('[1] "C:/Users/kim.muster/Documents"')
```
</div>

Note that the default working directory might look like that (at least if you are working on a Windows PC).

However, we might have all our files nicely organized at the following location: `C:\Users\kim.muster\Documents\my-project` (Figure 1).

![Figure 1: Windows Explorer](images/WindowsExplorer_schematic.png){#id .class width=60% height=60%}

How can we set the working directory to the location where all my files are? The following code will do the trick:

<div class = "input">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/kim.muster/Documents/my-project")
```
</div>

Some important remarks with respect to the different operating systems (OS):

* If you are working on Windows, you have to either use forward slashes `/` or double backslashes `\\` in the file path.
* For Mac users, your file path might look slightly different and could be something like `setwd("~/Documents/my-project")`.

Finally, with the command `dir()`, you can list all the files and directories in the current working directory. For our current one we would get:

<div class = "input">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dir()
```
</div>

<div class = "input">
```{r, echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat('[1] "Data"   "Plots"   "my-script.R"')
```
</div>
